Regularization: The CalculateErrors function includes regularization parameters, but they are not actively used in the training loop. Implementing regularization (L1, L2) could help prevent overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: The learning rate is hardcoded. It's crucial to explore different hyperparameter values (learning rate, initialization methods, activation functions) to find the optimal configuration for a specific problem.
Advanced Optimization: The training loop uses basic gradient descent. Consider implementing more advanced optimization algorithms like Adam or RMSprop for potentially faster convergence and better performance.
Saving and Loading Models: Adding functionality to save and load trained models would enable reuse and testing on new data without retraining.


Measuring, Validating, and Adjusting Parameters:
High Bias:
Increase model complexity (more neurons, layers).
Use more complex activation functions (e.g., ReLU, tanh).
Train longer.
High Variance:
Gather more data.
Use regularization (L1, L2, dropout).
Simplify the model.
Adaptive Learning Rate:
Implement techniques like Adam or RMSprop for automatic learning rate adjustment.
Consider learning rate schedules for manual adjustment.

Determining Activation Functions and Parameter Initialization:
Activation Functions:
Start with ReLU for hidden layers, as it's often a good default.
Use Softmax for multi-class classification in the output layer.
Experiment with others (sigmoid, tanh) if needed.
Parameter Initialization:
Use Xavier or He initialization for better convergence.
Avoid initializing all weights to zero.

Early Stopping:
Monitor validation loss:
Track loss on the validation set during training.
Stop if it doesn't improve for several epochs:
Terminate training to prevent overfitting.

Cross-Validation Comparison:
Divide data into multiple folds:
Use 5 or 10 folds for reliable results.
Train and evaluate on each fold:
Obtain average performance metrics across folds.
Compare different model configurations:
Use cross-validation results for informed model selection.
